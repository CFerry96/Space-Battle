Game Engines 2 Project

For this project i will be reinacting a scene from guardians of the galaxy 2 in where the guardians are being chased by a fleet of ships form the sovereign nation after rocket steals some of the very expensive batteries form the sovereigns.

Story Board
The marino emerges from the planet after carrying out their task for the sovereign nation followed thereafter by the sovereign fleet who are in pursuit.

The Sovereign ships are small amd quick and the marino will need to navigate the the asteroid belt in the thick space fog.

Upon leaving the asteroid belt the marino makes a manouver to evade some of the ships who willl then collide with eachother and be destroyed.

How It Works
Using several different behaviours the sovereign ships willl pursue the marino while attempting to avoid the asteroids . The marinoo will follow a premade path through the belt. The asteroids themselves are suspended in space but will rotate in random directions slowly and will break if a collision occurs with a ship. The Cameras change with timed co-routines and in the end an all black UI image will fade in by changing the alpha value.

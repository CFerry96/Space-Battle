Using several different behaviours the sovereign ships willl pursue the marino while attempting to avoid the asteroids. Should they collide there will be an explosion destroying the ship. The marinoo will follow a premade path through the belt. The asteroids themselves are suspended in space but will rotate in random directions slowly and will break if a collision occurs with a ship.
